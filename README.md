**Mobile-based IDE**

The project sets out to create a revolutionary mobile-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically tailored for smartphones. The aim is to empower aspiring developers and coding enthusiasts by providing them with a platform that seamlessly integrates coding capabilities into their mobile devices. The project seeks to transcend limitations by capitalizing on the capabilities of mobile phones, thereby empowering users to code at their convenience, irrespective of location. Unlike conventional IDEs, this mobile-based IDE prioritizes portability and accessibility, making coding a truly mobile experience. 
However, mobile devices still cannot compare with computers in terms of computing power and performance, and may be stretched when processing large and complex codes. This is due to hardware deficiencies that can cause the system to perform poorly. Therefore, the system's target audience also had to be narrowed.

**Features**

1. Project Creation and Navigation
MainActivity: The app starts with the MainActivity, where you can create new projects.
CreateNewPrj Activity: Here, users can input a project name and select a programming language to create a new project.
